Improving the Menu UI

Me: Is it possible to make my weather app’s command-line menu appear nicer and friendlier?
Great question! Try these improvements:


ChatGPT:

Add emoji icons to each menu item

Use spacing and lines to visually separate sections

Use action-oriented labels like “Check Current Weather”

Add loading indicators like “Fetching data...”

Use capitalized, descriptive prompts

Example:

print("\n🌤️ Welcome to WeatherWise 🌤️")
choice = pyip.inputMenu([
    '📍 Check Current Weather',
    '🧠 Ask a Weather Question',
    '📊 View Visualisations',
    '❌ Exit Application'], numbered=True)
Also consider giving user feedback before/after API calls.
