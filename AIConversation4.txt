Improving the Question Parser

Me: How could we make the current parser react correctly to more natural language?


ChatGPT:

def parse_weather_question:
    question = question.lower()
    parsed = {"location": None, "attribute": None}
    match = re.search(r'in ([a-zA-Z\s]+)', question)
    if match:
        parsed["location"] = match.group(1).strip()
    if 'rain' in question:
        parsed["attribute"] = 'rain'
    elif 'temperature' in question:
        parsed["attribute"] = 'temperature'
    else:
        parsed["attribute"] = 'general'
    return parsed

- You're off to a good start, but here’s how to improve:
- Your regex only works for “in [city]” but not “for [city]” or “[city] weather”
- Add fallback attribute detection: hot, cold, forecast, sunny
- Consider using NLP tools like spaCy if you want to extract locations more reliably
- Add logging or debugging info when no location is found
