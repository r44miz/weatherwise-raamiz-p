Why is this text better:

The improved version of the get_weather_data() function is better because it makes the application more robust, user-friendly, and reliable, especially in real-world scenarios where input errors, network issues, or incomplete API responses are common. By adding input validation, the function ensures that users provide meaningful and valid values for the location and forecast days, reducing the chance of errors and improving the overall user experience. Including a timeout in the API request prevents the application from freezing if the server is slow, which is essential for maintaining responsiveness. The use of raise_for_status() allows the function to catch and report specific HTTP errors like 404 (not found) or 503 (service unavailable), rather than silently failing or crashing. Additionally, checking that the required keys ("current_condition" and "weather") are present in the response helps detect cases where the API returns unexpected or partial data, enabling clearer error messages. Trimming the forecast data to match the number of days requested also ensures that the function behaves as expected and avoids unnecessary processing. Overall, these enhancements improve code quality by making it safer, more predictable, and easier to debug‚Äîkey qualities for any professional or academic software project.
