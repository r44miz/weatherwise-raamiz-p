Improving Visualisations

Me: What methods can I use to enhance my temperature and precipitation charts and make them more appealing?



ChatGPT:

You can add a lot of value with small visual improvements:

- Add titles like “🌡️ Temperature Forecast” or “🌧️ Rain Probability”
- Use red/blue lines for max/min temps to make it intuitive
- Add gridlines and axis labels for clarity
- Set rain chance chart’s Y-axis from 0 to 100
- Show a “Generating chart...” message before rendering

Example tweaks:

ax.set_title("🌡️ Temperature Forecast")
ax.plot(dates, max_temps, color='red')
ax.plot(dates, min_temps, color='blue')
ax.grid(True)
